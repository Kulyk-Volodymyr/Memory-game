# Memory Game

At the beginning of the game, all cards are closed. The player opens one card at a time. If the images are the same, the cards disappear. The game continues until all the cards are gone. The game has 9 levels - from 12 to 56 cards. The player can play with a time and/or turn limit, change the color theme and other settings.
